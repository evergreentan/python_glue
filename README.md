# python_glue
Using Python as a glue to integrate with Stata, Fortran, and etc.

## Motivation

> We should forget about small efficiencies, say about 97% of the time: premature optimization is the root of all evil. 

> â€“ Donald Knuth

As Sargent and Stachuski point out in the [Need for Speed](http://quant-econ.net/py/need_for_speed.html) section of the lecture notes for Python on Quant-econ, high productivity languages should be chosen over high speed languages for the great majority of scientific computing tasks as they can be used together with high-speed low-level languages.

## Stata
This section introduces how to run stata do file in python (IPython) in Windows and Mac OS X.

### 1. Write and execute stata commands in IPython

There is a nice module, [ipystata](https://github.com/TiesdeKok/ipystata), written Ties de Kok. You can find documentation about installation and usage in the GitHub page.

### 2. Run do files in IPython
#### Windows System
Prerequisites:
- Stata installed correctly.
- Stata installation directory: e.g. "C:\Program Files (x86)\Stata14\StataSE-64"

Reference:

#### Mac OS X
Prerequisites:
- Stata installed correctly.
- Install Stata(console) using the Terminal utility (this may not work with El Capatin as I have got error saying "The terminal utility could not be installed. ln: /usr/bin/stata-se: Operation not permitted" and I have El Capatin version 10.11.5)
- Installing Stata(console) by hand (if the previous step does not work) by adding "export PATH=$PATH:/Applications/Stata/StataSE.app/Contents/MacOS" in a .bash profile file. If there is no such file exists, make one and include the line in the previous quote. Make sure Stata is installed in the folder of Applications.

#### How to run do files in IPython
- Use call method from subprocess model.  
- See example in runstata.py under stata folder
